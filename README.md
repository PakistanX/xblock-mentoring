Mentoring XBlock
----------------

## Notice: This repo will be archived in April 2021. 

This XBlock allows to automate the workflow of real-life mentoring,
within an edX course.

**Warning: This is an outdated and deprecated version of the Mentoring XBlock.** Please upgrade to the latest version, Mentoring v2, aka Problem Builder: https://github.com/open-craft/problem-builder
 
If you have existing course content using Mentoring v1, you would need to upgrade that content to v2, see https://github.com/open-craft/problem-builder#upgrading-from-version-1 (note that you should do this at the beginning of a course run, before users start using it).
